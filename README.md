## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This is the first time working with background-images. Moving and positioning them to fit was challenging.

The moving box to the left was the most difficult part of this challenge. Having it being a child many levels deep and still have it overlaying it's grand-ish parent without overflowing was though to crack.

### Continued development

Styling and the HTML structure is all over the place. Trying some utility classes to have a cleaner CSS and I'm still finding myself repeating and overwriting the same properties and values. Kinda feel the JS lacking and too simplistic; only using it to change the active states of classes.

### Useful resources

Mozilla and w3schools were useful in various HTML, CSS and JS properties and attribute; specially for the moving box and background-images.

Kevin Powell youtube channel helped me in styling CSS in general.
